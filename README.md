## Guideline

Creating a .env file with API key

In order to use the API in your project, you will need to create a .env file in the root directory of your project, 
just like the .env.example file provided.

Copy the .env.example file in the root directory of your project and rename it to .env.
Replace the ******** variable in the .env file with an actual API key.
You can obtain an API key by creating an account on the OpenAI platform at [OpenAi](https://platform.openai.com/).
 If you have any trouble obtaining the API key, feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/godson-okezie-13593719a) .
The .env file is used to store environment variables, which are used by the application to access external services.
It is important that you do not share your API key with anyone, as it can be used to access your account and resources.
