# Crypto App

This project is a re-write for the [Crypto app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=howT44GSk_Y&list=WL&index=116&t=2098s) using [CoinMarket cap api](https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com)
to display a list of crypto currencies and their corresponding prices in USD($).
 
This is a re-write from scratch that introduces a new approach using the MVVM design pattern and Riverpod state management,
some new features added include theme mode preferences that allows user switch from dark theme to light theme depending on preference,
the new code also includes automated test(unit, widget and integration test) to test  and ensure features and functionalities meet requirements.
